# Logistic_Classifier

*Disclamer: This is a learning project which contains my narritive and was not refined. It's more of a story than production code.*

## Details
- Convert from gradient descent to the normal equation
- Convert prediction function by wrapping current with sigmoid function
- Convert cost function and gradient descent for logistic regression
- Test on a bigger data set and get it to work

## Outcome
Partially done in Python and TensorFlow. Instead moved on to my Kaggle competition since it taught me enough about low level TensorFlow fundamentals.
